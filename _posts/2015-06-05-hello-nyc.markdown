This morning I arrived at Penn Station on the Amtrak from Washington DC and it's soooooo good to be in NYC! Gearing up for a great weekend of events for everything OpenStreetMap, OpenTrails, Maptime and everything else. Exciting to see lots of talks about government interesting OpenStreetMap, as we just spent 3 days in DC at the invitation of the US Forest Service. Hear all about why in my OpenTrails talk tomorrow at 10:45!

Speaking of my talk (is that a pun?) here are a couple of posts you might want to check out to get excited to hear more about the first year of OpenTrails!

* **[On the Trail with Open Data][bffs]** - A  blog post we did for the run-up to the Spring Mapathons for the Great Outooors

* **[It's Better Out There][civic]** - A longer read that was publish in Civic Quarterly that provides a good narrative of the inception of OpenTrails. I'll touch and this and go into more detail on our with OpenStreetMap, as well what has been happening since then.

* **[TrailEditor : A Wyoming Outlaw][wyoming]** - Published today! A quick read on some rather crazy new legislation in Wyoming that comes down hard on citizen science and data collection!

If you've got a little extra time in NYC and want to checkout the parks, you should of course check out **[Central Park][central-park]**, but also a couple of ther gems like the **[High Line][high-line]** and **[Bryant Park][bryant-park]**.

I'll be at the kickoff party tonight for a little bit and then rest up for a big day tomorrow!

So excited to see everyone, meet new friends, learn new things and celebrate OpenStreetMap with everyone!

Cheers,

Jereme
