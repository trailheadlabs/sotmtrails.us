Do you love mapping parks and trails in OpenStreetMap? Do you work for a park steward that is curious about using OpenStreetMap to power your maps? Wondering how this fits in with Open Data? Are you a developer that wants to build awesome web or mobile apps to get people outside? If you answered yes to any of these questions and you are headed to [State of the Map US 2015][http://stateofthemap.us/] then you've come to the right place!

There are a few exiting happenings at SOTMUS this year that will explore OpenStreetMap as a platform for parks and recreation.

Jereme Monteau, CTO of Trailhead Labs, will be speaking on Monday June 6th at 11:45 AM in Room CR1 about [OpenTrails][opentrails-talk] and how it works with OpenStreetMap. He'll tell the story of how OpenTrails came to be, exactly how it works with OpenStreetMap and how it's already being used for a variety of purposes.

Later on June 6th at 3:00 PM also in Room CR1, Jereme will be on a [panel hosted by Drew Dara-Abrams to discuss peripheral data sets][peripheral-data-panel] with an exciting array of speakers from Mapillary, OpenAddresses, Transitland and PolygonCity.

There will be Birds of a Feather session dedicated to parks and recreation. Come meet everyone else that is exited about the great outdoors in OSM. Let's talk about our successes, challenges and how we might help each other! Exact time and place TBD.

We also recommend checking out [Paul Mach's talk][strava-talk] about how Strava not only uses OSM but is also coming up with intelligent ways to improve it with big data.

State of the Map US is less than 2 weeks away and we can't wait! This site will serve as a central source of information for all of the parks and recreation related activities happening there. Check back as we get closer and of course during the conference for updates.

We'll also be tweeting from various accounts including @trailheadlabs with the hashtag #sotmtrails so keep an eye out for those as well!
