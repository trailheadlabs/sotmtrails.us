2015 is an exciting year for the great outdoors at [State of the Map US][http://stateofthemap.us/]! There are several talks and other activities that will explore how OpenStreetMap can be used by the outdoor recreation community.

This site will serve as a central source of information for folks interested in these happenings!

This site is being maintained primarily by Jereme Monteau and Trailhead Labs as a service to the OSM community.
